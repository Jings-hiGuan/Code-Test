# Code-Test from Budvue
I saw this job from Indeed and think I am a good fit to this position. That is why I take this code test and apply for this postion. The dart file is the answer to the Code Test.

And my answer for the question "Are you able to work from home? (Do you have a quiet desk location and minimum 80mps download speed for Zoom calls)" is YES. I have been using Zoom and desktop for group meetings, online courses, App development for at least one year.

For the third question, my answer is still YES. My previous experience was a mobile app mainly developed in Dart using Flutter. The details are included in my resume. I am excited to hear from Budvue.
